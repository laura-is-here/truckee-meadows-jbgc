Truckee Meadows John Brown Gun Club (TMJBGC) is an anti-fascist, anti-racist, anti-authoritarian, pro-LGBTQ+, syndicalist community defense organization committed to accountable, community-led defense in the Truckee Meadows region of Northern Nevada.

We believe in **active resistance** to the corrosive and destructive social effects of white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, and economic exploitation.

We stand in defense of the **well-being of the community** over the enrichment of the individual, and we stand in solidarity with those who share our mission for a just future.
