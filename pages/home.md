    We work to counter the rise of fascist and far-right groups and entities in
    the Truckee Meadows.


    That includes disrupting fascists and their structures to keep them from
    effectively organizing, and especially resisting fascists holding public
    events and maintaining a public presence.


    We legally train community members for the purpose of community defense, and
    we don’t rely on the state to do our work for us.


    We fully stand for the right of all adults who would defend themselves and
    their communities against far-right violence. This right includes the right
    to own, carry, and train with tactically useful rifles, pistols, and body
    armor.

    Our name comes from the abolitionist John Brown, who, in 1859, led a raid on
    the armory at Harpers Ferry intending to start a slave liberation movement
    (with support from HarrietTubman).



    While that raid failed, Brown’s actions instilled fear in slave owners, and
    he was celebrated in the popular Union marching song, “John Brown’s Body.”


    Today, we are motivated by his famous quote:


    #### ***"What we need is action!"***
