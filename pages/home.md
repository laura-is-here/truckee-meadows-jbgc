  header: We Organize Against Fascism And Train In Defense
  image: /static/img/dont-tread-on-us.png
  content: >-
    We work to counter the rise of fascist and far-right groups and entities in
    the Truckee Meadows.



    That includes disrupting fascists and their structures to keep them from
    effectively organizing, and especially resisting fascists holding public
    events and maintaining a public presence.



    We legally train community members for the purpose of community defense, and
    we don’t rely on the state to do our work for us.



    We fully stand for the right of all adults who would defend themselves and
    their communities against far-right violence. This right includes the right
    to own, carry, and train with tactically useful rifles, pistols, and body
    armor.

    Our name comes from the abolitionist John Brown, who, in 1859, led a raid on
    the armory at Harpers Ferry intending to start a slave liberation movement
    (with support from HarrietTubman).


    While that raid failed, Brown’s actions instilled fear in slave owners, and
    he was celebrated in the popular Union marching song, “John Brown’s Body.”


    Today, we are motivated by his famous quote:


    #### ***"What we need is action!"***

  content: >-
    Washoe County has the opportunity to come together as neighbors and friends
    to help care for those of us most vulnerable to the economic disruption and
    health dangers of COVID-19: people facing homelessness, the elderly, the
    young, the immunocompromised, the poor, and others who are unable to restock
    the basic supplies they and their families need.




    We are creating a COVID-19 Mutual Aid Solidarity Network, comprised of
    different grassroots organizations, movements and organizers, who are
    committed to organizing mutual material support in the community. Our goal
    is to immediately provide grocery and supply deliveries, and eventually work
    toward expanding to other community support services like running errands,
    dog walking, childcare, caregiving, first line medical training and
    response, and mental health support for those impacted by the pandemic.

  header: To our community...
  content: >-
    We offer support upon request to those in our communities targeted by white
    supremacists and other agents of oppression and exploitation. We also offer
    trainings and concealed pistol license assistance.
