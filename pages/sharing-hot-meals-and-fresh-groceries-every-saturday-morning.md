*Because food is a right, not a privilege.*

Truckee Meadows John Brown Gun Club aims to act in solidarity to redistribute food in our city by working with the local [Washoe Food Not Bombs](https://twitter.com/WashoeFNB){rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank"} project. Washoe Food Not Bombs is an anarchist mutual aid project in which community members engage in direct action to address disparities in access to quality food.

Food Not Bombs illustrates that direct action can be a viable alternative to reliance on charities and non-profits, which reinforce the capitalist system through reproduction of the hierarchies and oppressive structures of that system.

All are welcome to share food with us ([unless you're a cop](https://aworldwithoutpolice.org/){rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank"}). We serve food every Saturday morning from 10am until 12pm, (or when supplies run out) at Bennett Park in downtown Reno, NV (across Arlington Ave from Wingfield Park).

For questions, or to get involved, please [contact us](/contact/) or contact Washoe Food Not Bombs on their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/WashoeFNB){rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank"}.
