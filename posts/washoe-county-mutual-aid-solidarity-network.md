Washoe County Mutual Aid Solidarity Network is an all-volunteer grassroots network operating in Washoe County, Nevada, connecting with multiple coalition partners throughout the region.

Washoe County has the opportunity to come together as neighbors and friends to help care for those of us most vulnerable to the economic disruption and health dangers of COVID-19: people facing homelessness, the elderly, the young, the immunocompromised, the poor, and others who are unable to restock the basic supplies they and their families need.

We are participating in a COVID-19 Mutual Aid Solidarity Network, comprised of different grassroots organizations, movements and organizers, who are committed to organizing mutual material support in the community. Our goal is to immediately provide grocery and supply deliveries, and eventually work toward expanding to other community support services like running errands, dog walking, childcare, caregiving, first line medical training and response, and mental health support for those impacted by the pandemic.
