We host monthly [Community Range Days](https://truckeemeadowsjbgc.org/posts/community-range-days/) (weather permitting) to legally train community members for the purpose of community defense, and we donâ€™t rely on the state to do our work for us.

We fully stand for the right of all adults who would defend themselves and their communities against far-right violence. This right includes the right to own, carry, and train with tactically useful rifles, pistols, and body armor.
