We work to counter the rise of fascist and far-right groups and entities in the Truckee Meadows.

That includes disrupting fascists and their structures to keep them from effectively organizing, and especially resisting fascists holding public events and maintaining a public presence.

We legally train community members for the purpose of community defense, and we donâ€™t rely on the state to do our work for us.

We fully stand for the right of all adults who would defend themselves and their communities against far-right violence. This right includes the right to own, carry, and train with tactically useful rifles, pistols, and body armor.
